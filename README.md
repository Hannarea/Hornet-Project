# Hornet-Project
This repo will contain all files pertaining to our hornets project. 

## To Do:
*Data:* 
- Organize the data we are using (verified, photo attached) into one place
- Convert the location data to rectangular coordinates
- Write code to read in location data with verifications (to create a prior positive locations vector)
- Label current images with 0's and 1's for the classification questions (color / stripes)
*Code:*
- get code up and running

## Some Comments 
- Maybe we should begin with the simplest case, a perceptron, as described in [4]
- We need to decide what the inputs will be ... they should be numbers
